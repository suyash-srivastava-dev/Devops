Nginx is one of the most powerful tools out here, and I have used it in production for many years ⚡

Here are the 8 key features that I believe every engineer should note, explore, configure, and experiment with 👇‍

1. it has high performance and a very low overhead
2. it can cache responses and reduce the load on backend servers
3. it can be used as a Reverse Proxy
4. it can balance the load across multiple servers
5. it can rewrite URLs are forward the apt request in the apt format
6. it can compress the content before sending, thus bettering
7. it has rate-limiting capabilities to prevent platform abuse DDoS
8. it can handle SSL/TLS termination and pass unencrypted requests to the backend servers
